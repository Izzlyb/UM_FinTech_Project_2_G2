# Proposal:

# Develop an application to perform finance management : Graham
    
It will implement Algorithmic trading, machine learning and visualization 
and portfolio management and evaluation.

We would be using the following libraries, these would be the 
dependencies of the project:

    - yfinance library to get data.
    - alpaca-api to get data and perform trades on a papertrading account.
    - sqlite database library to store data that needs to be persistent


## Setup of project:
A. We need to identify a set of stocks and ETF that and even cryptocurrencies that 
we want to work with so we use the same dataset.

B. Let's define what machine model we would be using for the project.


## Work distribution

1. (IJL) Create a machine learning model that can predict the price of an equity.
    I.- Package the model to be used by other people
    II.- Test the model with stocks, etf and commodities
    III.- Plot the results

2. (Eric) Create a backtesting model to evaluate two or three selected strategies.


3. (Ricky) With the selected strategies, evaluate each one by creating a portfolio and 
    computing the projected annual return.
    Make a recommendation based on personal preference or risk profile of a portfolio.
        This portfolio would have several components depending on the preferences or risk profile:
            A. A combination of selected stocks from the S&P 500.
            B. ETFs
            C. Bonds


4. (Samuel) Create a bot to use the selected ML model to do automated trading on 
    a paper account.
