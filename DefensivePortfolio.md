Defensive stocks as a group have a higher Sharpe ratio than the stock market as a whole. 

Once again, the defensive sectors are:
consumer staples        (XLP), 
healthcare              (XLV) 
and utilities           (XLU). 

Also less cyclical but not as defensive are:
real Estate         (XLRE)
Communications      (XLC)


## What Makes a Stock Defensive?

There's no universal definition of a defensive stock, but in general, they 
have the following characteristics:

    + Lower beta. Beta is a measure of a stock's sensitivity relative to 
    the overall movement of the market. Defensive stocks often have a 
    low (less than 0.5) or negative (less than 0) beta, meaning that on 
    average, they either move less in the same direction as the market or 
    in opposite directions altogether. 
    
    + Lower volatility. Standard deviation is a measure of the stock's historical 
    volatility – the range the stock's return has fluctuated around its historical 
    average. For instance, a defensive stock might have a historical return of 7% 
    annualized over 20 years, and a 20-year standard deviation of 10%, while a cyclical 
    stock might have a higher historical return of 10% annualized over 20 years, but 
    a greater 20-year standard deviation of 20%. In this case, the latter is significantly 
    more volatile than the former. 
    
    + Counter-cyclicality. Defensive stocks often come from market sectors with evergreen 
    demand. That is, regardless of economic conditions, consumers and businesses will still 
    purchase their products and services without too much of a drop-off. This includes 
    sectors like health care, utilities and consumer staples. This stands in contrast to 
    cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary, information technology, real estate 
    and industrials that depend on favorable economic conditions for growth.
    
    + Solid fundamentals. Defensive stocks often have stronger fundamentals in the form 
    of wider operating margins, better return on equity and return on assets, stronger 
    current ratios and debt-to-equity ratios, consistent operating cash flow, higher total 
    cash per share and positive earnings per share. Often, they may pay a dividend as well, 
    although this is not guaranteed.

### Utilities

People depend on gas, electricity, water, and other utilities in daily life. Utility 
stocks include companies that provide or deliver these services. They are defensive 
because consumers still need them during an economic decline. This fact makes the 
prices of defensive utility stock funds less sensitive to market fluctuations. 
Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU) is an example of this kind of defensive sector fund.4

This broad defensive sector includes hospitals and other healthcare facilities, 
insurance companies, drug and medical instrument manufacturers, and biomedical 
companies. Healthcare is a defensive sector because these companies offer products 
or services that consumers will still need to buy in hard times. After all, health 
is a primary concern, and people still visit doctors and refill their prescriptions 
even when they can't afford other goods.

Consumer staples, also known as "consumer non-cyclical stocks," tend to 
maintain more price stability in a down market than cyclical stocks. 
During an economic decline, consumers still need staples, such as cereal 
and milk, and they may even increase their use of so-called "sin stock" 
products, such as cigarettes and alcohol. Knowing this, some investors buy 
defensive sector funds, such as Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC), 
when they think a recession will occur.1


### Real Estate Sector

Apartment REITs
Apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs) are also deemed defensive, 
as people always need shelter. 

    - Digital Realty (DLR)
    - American Tower (AMT)
    - Prologis (PLD)
    - Simon Property Group (SPG)
    - Boston Properties (BXP)


### Telecommunication Services

This sector includes companies that offer communication services through cellular, 
fiber-optic, fixed-line, wireless, and high-bandwidth networks. Their businesses 
follow known patterns through each phase of the economic cycle and thus tend to 
preserve value as the economy moves into a recession. Fidelity Select Communication 
Services Portfolio (FBMPX) is one such mutual fund that grants investors exposure 
to this sector.3

    - Comcast (CMCSA)
    - AT&T (T)
    - Dish Network (DISH)
    - Discovery Communications (WBD)
    - Activision Blizzard (ATVI)


### Certain Commodities

Commodities include crude oil, coal, corn, tea, rice, gold, and silver. Not all of 
these basic goods are defensive by default, but some can maintain stable prices during 
an economic decline. For instance, gold has historically produced a high return amid 
economic volatility because many investors see it as a safer alternative to stocks. 
Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (FSAGX) is an example of a mutual fund that targets 
gold.5
